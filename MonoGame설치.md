MoneGame설치 전에 

알아둬야할 것들

나는 일단 최신버전으로 사용할 예정.

Visual Studio 2022사용하고 있고 MoneGame 3.8.1부터 Visual Studio 2022을 사용할 수 있기에.

## Visual Studio 2022 extension

MonoGame 3.8.1 now comes with an optional Visual Studio extension which will install all the MonoGame project templates and will allow a quick access to the [MGCB Editor](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/tools/mgcb_editor.html).

This extension is avaible for Visual Studio 2022, and Visual Studio 2022 for Mac.

## Visual Studio 2019 and prior are no more supported

Because .NET 6 isn't supported by Visual Studio 2019, starting with MonoGame 3.8.1 it will no more be possible to build games with it.

Moving forward, we will only support Visual Studio 2022, and Visual Studio 2022 for Mac.

If you need to use Visual Studio 2019, we encourage you to stick to MonoGame 3.8.0.

JetBrains Rider and Visual Studio Code can be used regardless of the version of MonoGame.
